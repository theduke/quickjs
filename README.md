# SlimJS

SlimJS is a (**very much WIP**) lightweight Javascript engine written in `Rust` and ported from [QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/). 

## Origins

The codebase was ported from [QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/), a `C` Javascript runtime written by Fabrice Bellard and Charlie Gordon.

Right now the code looks much more like C than idiomatic Rust,
but will be incrementally rewritten to benefit from the added safety and better maintainability that Rust provides.

If you'd like to help out, get in touch, or just pick any random part of the code and start refactoring. 
There is a lot to do!
